                    The \'\'\'monarchs of Portugal\'\'\' ruled from the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], in 1139, to the deposition of the Portuguese monarchy and creation of the [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]] with the [[5 October 1910 revolution]]. \n \n Through the nearly 800 years in which Portugal was a monarchy, the kings held various other titles and pretensions. Two kings of Portugal, Ferdinand I and Afonso V, also claimed the [[crown of Castile]]. When the house of Habsburg came into power, the [[kings of Spain]], 
                    [[kings of Naples|Naples]], and [[kings of Sicily|Sicily]] also became kings of Portugal. The house of Braganza brought numerous titles to the Portuguese Crown, including [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves|King of Brazil]] and then de jure [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]]. \n \n After the demise of the Portuguese monarchy, in 1910, Portugal almost restored its monarchy in a revolution known as the [[Monarchy of the North]], though the attempted restoration only lasted a month bef
                    ore destruction. With Manuel II\'s death, the [[Miguelist]] branch of the house of Braganza became the pretenders to the throne of Portugal. They have all been acclaimed king of Portugal by their monarchist groups. \n \n The monarchs of Portugal all came from a single ancestor, [[Afonso I of Portugal]], but direct lines have sometimes ended. This has led to a variety of royal houses coming to rule Portugal, though all having Portuguese royal lineage. These houses are: \n \n * The \'\'\'[[Portuguese House of Burgundy|House of Burgundy]]\'\'\' (1139–1383) \n * The \'\'\'[[House of Aviz]]\'\'\' (1385–1581) \n * The \'\'\'[[Philippine Dynasty|House of Habsburg]]\'\'\' (1581–1640) \n * The \'\'\'[[House of Braganza]]\'\'\' (1640–1910) \n \n ==House of Burgundy (1139–1383)== \n {{The monarchs of the Iberian Peninsula}} \n The \'\'\'[[Portuguese House of Burgundy]]\'\'\', known as the \'\'\'Afonsine Dynasty\'\'\', was the founding house of the Kingdom of Portugal. Prior to the independence of Portugal, the house ruled the feudal [[County of Portugal]], of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. When Alphonso I Henriques declared the independence of Portugal, he turned the family from a comital house to a royal house which would rule Portugal for over two centuries. \n When Ferdinand I died, a [[1383–1385 Crisis|succession crisis]] occurred and Ferdinand\'s daughter [[Beatrice of Portugal]] was proclaimed queen and her husband [[John I of Castile]] proclaimed king by [[Jure uxoris|the right of his wife]]. Her legitimacy as a monarch is disputed. < ref > David Williamson, «Debrett\'s Kings and Queens of Europe»,1988,Webb  &  Bower, Exeter, {{ISBN|0-86350-194-X}}; César Olivera Serrano, [http://www.google.pt/search?hl=pt-PT & client=firefox-a & rls=org.mozilla%3Apt-PT%3Aofficial & channel=s & q=%22Segunda+Maqueta+Beatriz+Portugal.pmd%22 & btnG=Pesquisar & aq=f & aqi= & aql= & oq= & gs_rfai= «Beatriz de Portugal»] < /ref > < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?ei=3OWoTMqfHY2EswbgsP29DA & ct=result & id=A51pAAAAMAAJ & dq= & q=beatriz+regente+1383#search_anchor García de Cortázar, Fernando (1999), \'\'Breve historia de España\'\', Alianza Editorial, page 712]; Armindo de Sousa, in História de Portugal coordinated by José Mattoso, Editorial Estampa, vol.

In fact, while king Carlos died instantly under the bullets of the anarchists on 1 February 1908, his son Luís Filipe, the crown prince, survived for a few hours, enough to allow governmental officials to name him king. This act is, however, usually considered as historically irrelevant, given that the crown prince never recovered from his coma. His younger brother Manuel (who was also injured, though not seriously) is therefore considered to have been the direct successor of the murdered king Carlos I. < /ref > \n | image16      = SMF Manoel II.jpg \n }} \n \n ==Line of succession== \n {{see|Line of succession to the former Portuguese throne}} \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|Portugal|Monarchy}} \n {|   \n | \n *[[List of Portuguese monarchs by age at accession to the throne]] \n *[[List of Portuguese monarchs by longevity]] \n *[[List of Portuguese royal consorts]] \n *[[List of titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown]] \n *[[Style of the Portuguese sovereign]] \n |valign=top| \n *[[Kings of Portugal family tree]] \n *[[Descendants of John VI of Portugal]] \n *[[Descendants of Manuel I of Portugal]] \n *[[Descendants of Miguel I of Portugal]] \n  |  \n |} \n \n ==References== \n {{reflist|30em}} \n \n ==Bibliography== \n {{refbegin}} \n * {{Cite book |last=Sousa |first=D.
